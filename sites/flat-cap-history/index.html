            <h2>Origins: A Hat Born of Law</h2>
            <p>The flat cap's history stretches back over 500 years, making it one of the most enduring pieces of headwear in Western fashion. Its origins are uniquely tied to English law and social class distinctions that shaped clothing for centuries.</p>

                    <p>The English Parliament passes an act requiring all males over six years of age, except nobility and persons of degree, to wear woolen caps on Sundays and holidays. This was designed to boost the domestic wool trade and clearly distinguish social classes.</p>

            <h2>The Irish Connection</h2>

            <div class="irish-box">
                <h3>The Paddy Cap</h3>
                <p>In Ireland, the flat cap is often called the <strong>"Paddy cap"</strong> or simply the <strong>"flat cap"</strong>. It became so associated with Irish identity that it's sometimes called the "Irish flat cap" internationally. The cap was particularly prevalent in rural Ireland, where it was worn by farmers, fishermen, and laborers throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
            </div>

            <p>The relationship between Ireland and the flat cap runs deep. During the Great Famine (1845-1852) and subsequent waves of emigration, Irish immigrants brought the cap with them to America, Australia, and beyond. The cap became a symbol of Irish working-class resilience and identity in diaspora communities worldwide.</p>

            <div class="quote">
                "You could tell an Irishman anywhere in the world by his flat cap and his way of wearing it - slightly tilted, with quiet dignity."
                <br><small>- Traditional Irish saying</small>
            </div>

            <p>Irish tweed, particularly from Donegal, became the preferred material for quality flat caps. Donegal tweed, with its distinctive flecks of color, remains highly prized for cap-making to this day. The Harris Tweed from Scotland offers similar quality and heritage.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>Construction & Materials</h2>
            <p>A quality flat cap is more than just a piece of cloth - it's a carefully constructed garment with specific components that have remained largely unchanged for centuries.</p>

            <h3>Anatomy of a Flat Cap</h3>
            <p>The classic flat cap consists of a rounded crown sewn to a stiff peak (also called a brim or bill). The crown is typically made from multiple panels - traditionally eight - sewn together and often lined with silk or cotton. A button at the crown's center is traditional, though not universal. The sweatband inside helps absorb moisture and ensures a comfortable fit.</p>

        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>Flat Cap vs. Newsboy Cap</h2>
            <p>While often confused, the flat cap and newsboy cap are distinct styles:</p>

            <h3>The Flat Cap (Paddy Cap)</h3>
            <p>A low-profile cap with a single piece of fabric forming the crown. It sits close to the head with a neat, streamlined appearance. This is the traditional Irish and British style.</p>

            <h3>The Newsboy Cap (Gatsby Cap)</h3>
            <p>A fuller, rounder cap with eight panels meeting at a button on top. It has more volume and a puffier appearance. This style became particularly associated with American newspaper sellers in the early 20th century, hence the name.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>

            <h3>Symbol of the Working Class</h3>
            <p>For centuries, the flat cap distinguished workers from the top-hatted upper classes. It became a badge of honest labor and working-class pride, particularly in industrial regions of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland.</p>

            <h3>Irish Identity</h3>
            <p>In Ireland, the flat cap became intertwined with national identity during the struggle for independence. It represented the common man, rural life, and traditional values. Even today, it remains a powerful symbol of Irish heritage.</p>

            <p>The flat cap has strong associations with golf, horse racing, and hunting. It remains standard attire at British and Irish race courses and golf clubs, bridging working-class origins with gentlemanly pursuits.</p>

            <h3>Modern Revival</h3>
            <p>Today's flat cap wearers range from hipsters rediscovering heritage style to elderly gentlemen who never stopped wearing them. The cap has achieved that rare status: a garment that's simultaneously traditional and fashionable.</p>
